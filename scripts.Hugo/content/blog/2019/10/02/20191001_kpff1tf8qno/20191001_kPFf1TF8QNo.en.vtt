00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.200
On our march, can you see

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.820
In this land the stoutest hearts?

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.760
To all in arms: despite the odds

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.980
We all shall drive away the night.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.380
Before the dawn, a voice afar

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.960
Rings out and pierces through the mist.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.680
To all our kin who would not bow:

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.640
You are the light of our Hong Kong.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.160
Justice marks our banner in this fight,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.440
Let our tears and blood not shed in vain!

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.840
For all sacrifices past, we vow:

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.720
Hold our fort for thousand ages still,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.340
Keep our hope yet burning for our land.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.820
In the darkest hour we blaze our creed:

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.700
Righteousness to all men.
