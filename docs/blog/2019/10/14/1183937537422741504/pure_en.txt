What have we done wrong?
I am pretty normal
Why
I have to bear your cross-examination?
(Passerby, man)
I just passed by.
Everyone is shopping, I am wearing this, not like 
a Thug, right?
Just wait,
I really 
Just come out shopping.
(Probably to check ID card)
What is going on?
If you have something,
I will stay with you.
Because I am also a HongKonger
You help me forward this out
I want to stay here all the time.
Wait until things are over
I have to stay here all the time.
Wait until things are over
I have to find
their commander
So the brothers and sisters
Don't worry about me
I know, I don't want to
you are working hard for me.
Yes 
What I saw is true,
Hong Kong is very messy now.
Many people indulged themselves in it
However,
Born to die
You are also a native of HongKong
Why
Treat us Hong Kong people like this?
Yes, high-level orders
You can't resist
